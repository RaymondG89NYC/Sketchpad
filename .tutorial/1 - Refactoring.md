# Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of rewriting a section (or all) or your code so that it is more extensible. This can be an especially useful step before adding additional features to a working minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP is often in the early stages of development and refactoring code may occur frequently.



The first couple of suggestions for improvement will be refactoring steps.

<summary>Why Refactoring is a Good Thing</summary>
We have had some experience refactoring in our Inheritance lesson. We re-implemented our ClearButton by creating a new parent class SquareButton. Had we started with SquareButton, all other buttons would have been less to write and we could save ourselves a lot of future work.

### Refactoring Doesn't Have to be Tedious

Refactoring your code is something you will find yourself doing a lot. One common workflow is to build something "badly" first, just to make sure your idea will work in the first place, then refactor the code later so that you can build upon the idea.

Refactoring can at times be difficult and important, however, it can also be thought of as the victory lap after you've seen your early design working. Now it's time to get serious.
