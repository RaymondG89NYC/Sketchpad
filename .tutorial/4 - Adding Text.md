# Adding Text

One method found in the `PaintingTool.java` file not used in this program is `drawText`. The `drawText` method takes in something unique, `java.lang.String str` as a parameter. This is Java's `String` class.

Strings are a data type used to store text. A literal String can be made by typing any text inside of `""`s.

Example: `String errorMessage = "404 Page not found";`

### Strings

Aside from numbers and booleans, Strings are some of the most used data types in programming. They can be used to store text based values, like the name of a customer, the current type of weather, or almost any other typable values.

Java's `String` class has many methods which you will become familiar with in a deeper dive in the language.

To learn more about the `String` class, check out the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html).

## Your Task

Add some text onto your program. You could choose to *sign* your name on top of the border in the bottom right corner, or you could choose to add a text-logo somewhere else, perhaps the title of `"SketchPad"`.
